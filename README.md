# haphpipe_bioinformaticsclass
Github repository for Fall 2019 GW bioinformatics class for working with HAPHPIPE.

Overall for your project, you will be taking viral NGS data throughout two premade pipelines in HAPHPIPE. You will be making a user guide for future undergrads to use, documenting your frequently asked questions, and learning how to implement a pipeline.

A template User Guide can be found [here](https://github.com/kmgibson/haphpipe_bioinformaticsclass/blob/master/Haphpipe_UserGuide_template.md). I have also put a copy for each of you within your relative folder. 


**Tutorials to complete prior to starting:** <br>
This is if you are unfamiliar with bash coding and markdown files.

- [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/lesson/1/)
- [Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)
- [Bash scripting](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line/modules/bash-scripting)

**Prior to starting, please read:**

1. Your manuscript associated with your data.
2. General guidlines to HAPHPIPE [here](https://github.com/gwcbi/haphpipe).
3. Use [bedtools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/annotate.html) as your inspiration for describing the modules.
4. If you are running on Colonial One, you need to request an interactive node. Go [here](https://github.com/gwcbi/HPC/blob/master/interactive_jobs.md) to learn how to run interactive jobs.


## Directions 
Directions from Keylie and Maggie to help guide you:

It's mostly just an explanation of what you did + your notes on how to get it to work. Write down every question you have or google - nothing is "stupid." Also, try googling your question first, then reaching out to us or bringing it to haphpipe hours. If google helped you - document the link or sources that helped answer your question. Please read your associated paper, give me a paragraph about their study and a paragraph about their NGS technique.

Emails: kmgibson@gwu.edu and steinerm@gwu.edu 

HAPHPIPE Hours: Tuesday and Thursday [TBD - just email for the moment]

1. Please start with completing "Basics," "Questions to answer in your own words," "Installing HAPHPIPE," and "Activating HAPHPIPE."
2. Once [1] is completed, please complete HAPHPIPE suite. Figure out what each module does and what each stage is meant to do.
3. Once you've familiarized yourself with HAPHPIPE a bit, I will give you your data to start messing with! 

GOAL: Create a Bioinformatic journal Application Note for class and use the User Guide as a supplemental material for that paper.
